## Selected Project Description 💂‍♂️

For our team project we selected Coraza Web Application Firewall.

### What is Coraza WAF?
Coraza WAF is an enterprise grade Web Application Firewall written in Go
that provides support for both the Apache Modsecurity SecLang rules and 
OWASP CRSv4. Coraza is an OWASP Production level project and
while at it's core it is a library it is highly extendable
and can be implemented as an appliance with a GUI. The Coraza project
maintains a number of plugins for additional features such as the 
aforementioned GUI, Nginx support, HA, and WASM.

### Who Are The Contributors to Coraza WAF?

Coraza WAF has 44 contributors according to GitHub, however these numbers
include bots such as renovate and dependabot. At it's core there are two developers
whose contributions easily eclipise the the contributions of the third listed developer
by commit metrics.

### Coraza WAF Activity

Coraza WAF has recent pushes from the current week and has been under development
for a number of years. There are currently 30 open PR's, 68 issues, and a number
of threads in the discussion section as well as alternative community channels.
In the past week there have been 7 merged PR's and 1 closed issue. In the past two
weeks the repository has ran over 3K GitHub actions workflows at over 6k minutes.

### Who Uses Coraza WAF?

While Coraza WAF doesn't have the deep market penetration that other OWASP projects
may enjoy the software does has a fairly large user base according to the dependency graph
available on GitHub. The dependency graph notes 140+ dependents, with some fairly popular repositories
such as: 
- [Perforator 3.246 Stars and 146 Forks] (https://github.com/yandex/perforator)
- [Easegress 5,851 Stars and 493 Forks] (https://github.com/easegress-io/easegress)
- [CrowdSec 11,155 Stars and 536 Forks] (https://github.com/crowdsecurity/crowdsec)

### Coraza WAF Popularity

Coraza WAF has 2.9k Stars, 280 Forks, with 37 people watching the repository.
Coraza WAF has 152 dependent repositories and 105 dependent packages.
So while the WAF may not seem popular directly it is a key component for several
other inputs with a few notably popular projects in the dependencies.

### What Languages Does Coraza WAF Use?

The WAF itself is written in pure Golang.

### Documentation Sources

Coraza WAF documentation is mainly found on the Coraza.io website, however
OWASP also maintains a page dedicated to Coraza and the discussion and Issues
sections of GitHub also contain a wealth of information in addition to the example
code found on the main GitHub.

## Team Reflections 🏁

### Jmcshannon 

**What did you learn from this assignment**

For me the biggest takeaway from this proposal was the amount of work involved in all 
of the additional overhead needed to run a moderately successful open source project.
While the team has OWASP Production Product status and have already written the web
application firewall in Golang, there are still a myriad of tasks for the team to work on
to drive community engagement and further adoption.

**What did you find the most useful**

I found the dependency graph to be extremely useful and something I hadn't really 
spent a lot of time looking at before. The dependency graph also sports an Export
as SBOM feature which is super useful.
